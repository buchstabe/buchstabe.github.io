There are a lot of good and excellent introductions and advanced books
on algorithmic design. Many of them describe the topic in a language
agnostic way, some others concentrate on a particular language (e.g.
Java).

The following <a

to introduce beginners how to implement basic algorithms and data
structures in Ruby.
