There are a lot of good and excellent introductions and advanced books
on algorithmic design. Many of them describe the topic in a language
agnostic way, some others concentrate on a particular language (e.g.
Java).

The following [resource](https://web.archive.org/web/20100110172902/http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus8/)
is an attempt to introduce beginners how to implement basic algorithms
and data structures in Ruby.
