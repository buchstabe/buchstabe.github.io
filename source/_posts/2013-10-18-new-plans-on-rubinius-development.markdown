A new milestone in the Rubinius' development has been announced on October, 15th.
The new project is called _Rubinius X_ and should simplify obstacles in the Ruby world.

[Rubinius X](http://x.rubini.us/) aims to create a new industry friendly Ruby environment
which should prevent the endangered Ruby language from [dying](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1oi8wd/ruby_is_a_dying_language/).
