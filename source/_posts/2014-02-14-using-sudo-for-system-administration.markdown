We can face the situation with restricted rights on a server. This is a use case for <code>sudo</code>. You can get restricted access to specific commands as <code>root</code>, but not to the whole system, which is very good!

I need access to <code>virt-top</code> to monitor kvm based virtual machines on a big host system. Add the following line to <code>sudoers</code> file:

```
myusername ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/virt-top
```

This line allows <code>myusername</code> to run <code>virt-top</code> without password from any terminal.
